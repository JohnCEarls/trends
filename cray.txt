Overview: We are using the sum of archived human expression data to
create a collection of statistical classifiers covering <as many
phenotypes as we can think of>.  This set of classifiers would
provide a "molecular signature" for each of the phenotypes used in
training, such that any new expression dataset could then be
identified 



We will use as much expression data as is publicly available
to create statistical classifiers for as many phenotypes as possible.

Something about molecular signatures

Background: Description of classifiers.
A classifier is a statistical test that, once trained, provides a
yes/no classification to a new input data set with minimal computation
resources required.

Inclusion of meta-data



What we're actually doing:
1. Download expression data from GEO, ArrayExpress, OncoMine, etc
   (including meta data).
2. Catagorize each expression dataset using the metadata associated
   with it, and run clustering algorithms to create classifier
   training sets.
3. Create classifiers based on said training sets.
4. We will then monitor the expression data repositories for new
   expression sets as they become available.  Upon such an event, the
   new expression set will be both compared to the existing
   classifiers to identify its nature and incorporated into the
   existing classifier set to increase the accuracy of those
   classifiers. 
5. Something about identifying trends across time.
6.
