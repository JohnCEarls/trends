Outline of project:
- gather all the (human) expression data from public repositories;
  normalize as needed.  (Currently, just GEO, but more to follow).
- assign one or more classes to each expression set, based on
  metadata. (current bottleneck).
- build a set of (overlapping?) classifiers (one per phenotype).
- as new data is uploaded, check it against appropriate classifiers.
- Does classifier accuracy improve? Yay!  Otherwise, find out why and consider splitting classes as needed.
- record provenance for all actions s.t. data history can be reconstituted.

Immediate Challenges: 
- how to assign phenotypes/classes to expression sets based on meta data (title, description)

Short term:
- build "mini" pipeline demonstrating proof-of-concept
- gather data from other sources and incorporate
- apply classifiers to sample data sets
- record provenance
- query system for specific class reports
 

Long term: 
- what are the trends of expression data for each disease? (Nathan can
  fill this in more fully).  Figure out a query/report system.
- build accurate molecular signatures for every class/phenotype.
- Make decisions about if and how we would like this to be publicly
  accessible.  Needs a web interface?
- Can we incorporate other types of data?
