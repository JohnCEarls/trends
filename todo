Rebuild database:

parse_soft.pl -> datasets, dataset_subsets, samples
 sample->dataset pointers
 sample->subset pointers
 word2geo for title, description

write GEO::*->display routines

parse_series.pl -> series, raw_samples
 field checking for series.csv; definitely some weirdness
 download only as necessary
 rs->gse pointers
 rs->path
 word2geo for title
 series->dataset pointers where they exist (series.csv[6])

RawSamples->next()
Series->next()
Dataset->next()
DatasetSubset->next()
Sample->next()		# for dataset samples

So: raw_samples->series_ID must be raw_samples->series_IDS; use case
  is GSM577841, which has at least two series attached: GSE23554 and GSE23603
